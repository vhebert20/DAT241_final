# Solar Site Assessment, Allegheny County PA
## DAT241 Final Project


### ABSTRACT:

The advent of renewable energy makes finding possible locations for wind and solar farms/facilities an important step in the shift of energy sources.  Spatial software makes the task easier, but involves multiple data sources and process steps.  An initial highgrading of locations can involve basic spatial and geographic values, such as slope severity, slope aspect, and distance to existing infrastructure.  Utilizing these parameters, the number of acres falling with Allegheny County, Pennsylvania municipal areas was calculated for this project, resulting in a final map and table highgrading focus areas for further analysis.


### INQUIRY:

In this project, ArcGIS Pro was used to analyse attributes of Allegheny County, PA to determine prospective locations for solar facilities.  It focuses on slope (less than 20 degrees), distance from a transmission line (within one mile), slope aspect (south facing between 135-225 degrees), and current land cover/usage (forest/grasslands, agricultural, and strip mine) then ranks municipal areas based on the number of acres of potential property.
